Shortly after this, I changed to a HP/Palm Pre3, which I am still using.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/birkett26/13888836611/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7117/13888836611_f15aea05f2.jpg\" alt=\"N95 8GB\" width=\"500\" height=\"263\" /></a></p>\n<p>I like reviewing things. I find I can talk for hours about how that circular thing rotates along a 270 degree plane, only to return to its initial position with a satisfying spring loaded action. Not too much spring, just enough to give a satisfying feel of quality. It&rsquo;s a stainless steel circular thing by the way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may sound strange to be reviewing a 4 year old phone, but for reasons that will become apparent, this is the most appropriate way. I don&rsquo;t understand how &ldquo;reviewers&rdquo; can give an honest opinion of a product having only used it for a few days prior to the review. I find that the outcome usually goes along the lines of &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get the chance to use this to its full potential, but generally I didn&rsquo;t like it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I love it, buy one&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have used this phone every day for 3 and a half years, 1,213 days to be precise. I believe that is long enough to give an honest opinion, of all features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before the N95, I was a proud owner of a Samsung E900. Not the fanciest of phones looking back, but still served me well. An unfortunate smelting charging accident left it somewhat limited in use. That left me phone shopping for a day or two.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I had been looking at these new-fangled &ldquo;smartphones&rdquo; that seemed to be gaining a reputation at the time. Touch screens had not yet made a big break into the phone world and built in WiFi was something still limited to only the most up-market phones and PDA&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When phone buying, I look for something that will last. I don&rsquo;t mind putting in a comparably large investment if it will last. I don&rsquo;t tend to follow the crowd (I have a habit of hating most of the popular gadgets), I look for quality and features. So along comes the N95 and the N95 8GB, modestly taking its place at the top of the smartphone market. It certainly didn&rsquo;t come in cheap, but it packed almost all of the cutting edge features at the time into a form factor that became a landmark icon for Nokia. To this day, I no other phone comes to mind that has a two way slide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I remember unboxing the N95, which Nokia seems to make an enjoyable experience. I got my N95 from 3 UK, so it came with the usual carrier locks and branded firmware. However, 3 kept all the packaging vanilla. The phone came packaged with a USB cable, mains charger, TV output cable, Driver CD, earphones and documentation. I&rsquo;m not a believer in reading the Quick Start guides, so I jammed in a SIM card and went for it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first boot took an age. It wasn&rsquo;t even a user friendly age, a white screen, no icons, no back light, nothing. I now know that this is normal on first boot, or after a reset &ndash; but still &ndash; an animated boot splash couldn&rsquo;t have gone a miss.</p>\n<p>Initial set up was quick and easy, the usual time / date and language choices. Network APN&rsquo;s and message gateways where automagically set up for me, so I could start using the phone immediately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It took me a few days to get used to things, notably the different space key placement, one of the finer details of moving from Samsung to Nokia.</p>\n<p>For its time, the battery life wasn&rsquo;t great. I was pressed to get 3 days moderate use out of it before having the phone refuse to turn back on. The old E900 was quite frugal on power, regularly turning back on when all the indicators said 0%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Zoom forward over 1000 days, the old faithful is still going strong. Not once have I been disappointed by lack of features compared to modern phones. The camera keeps up with the newer Sony Ericsson CyberShot (I&rsquo;ve compared with the K850i, C902 and W995). To be fair, there is a difference. For a quick photo to remember something (which is what phone cameras are for?) the N95 will still hold its own, even against dedicated digital cameras. Start talking about Full-HD recording and bi-directional microphones, then I&rsquo;m in second place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WiFi has always been reliable for me, Bluetooth has never put a foot wrong. GPS on the other hand has been a nightmare. I have never been able to get it to reliably connect, making the N95 as a navigation device quite useless.</p>\n<p>Call and audio quality has been fantastic, loud speakers still pack enough power for most scenarios.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I use the N95 for SMS (texting), a lot. The only issue I have ever had, is with the inbox. Once you have more that 1500 messages stored in there, things become noticeably sluggish. Simple fix though, move the messages to &ldquo;My Folders&rdquo;, or simply delete them. (On this note, I have found <a title=\"ABC Amber NBU Converter\" href=\"http://www.processtext.com/abcnbu.html\" target=\"_blank\">ABC Amber NBU Converter</a>&nbsp;an invaluable tool for extracting and archiving messages from a Nokia backup file)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My biggest observation about this phone after a few years though, the build quality. Yes, it&rsquo;s a bit battered and bruised on the back &ndash; but the slide is still tight, the buttons and keypad still feel sharp and nothing has fallen off or chipped. About 6 months ago, it even got wet, to the point where it decided to switch itself off. 2 hours later, having removed the battery and let it roast on a radiator, it fires back into life no problem. I am disappointed though, it asked me for the time and date!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Symbian has continued to be sub-par next to its rivals, Nokia Ovi has been an attempt to change this &ndash; but has sadly gained a rather bad reputation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4 years after release, this phone is showing it&rsquo;s age. It is for that reason, and that reason alone &ndash; I sadly cannot recommend this phone to people any more. It&rsquo;s a fantastic phone, it has served me well for a very long time, but it&rsquo;s time to be retired.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Well done Nokia, you created a phone that has become a deserving icon for your company.</p>',0,1),(3,1397905069,'Car Insurance','<p><em>From the archives.

One wanted to charge me just over the total value of the car, another wanted less than half my renewal quote. It&rsquo;s like these people just pull arbitrary numbers out of their money shitting arseholes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have my no claims bonus, drive sensibly, look after the car and have a regular income. Why then, is it such a problem to offer me a decent premium based on me &ndash; not the drivers causing accidents and fraudulently claiming? Look at it this way insurers: chances are, my policy will never need to pay out. It&rsquo;s pure profit for you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I went with the most sensible quote, got windscreen cover, legal protection and Business Class 1 included for next to nothing. I\'m quite happy with the Nationwide right now. I can&rsquo;t say that for the likes of Quinn Direct and others who are charging extortionate prices, not even attempting to be competitive.</p>\n<p>Scamming bastards.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',0,1),(5,1404388009,'Tips for running CyanogenMod on a Galaxy S (i9000)','<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5505/14561090361_218dbcb08b_b.jpg\" alt=\"AndroidBatter\" width=\"800\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"CyanogenMod\" href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.org\" target=\"_blank\">CyanogenMod </a>is fantastic.

For a long time, these guys were the main Saab dealer in the area.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">2010 comes along, and GM pull the plug on Saab. The factory closes its doors, the brand changes ownership a few times, and eventually folds. For the customers, this wasn&rsquo;t a massive deal &ndash; dealers mostly stuck around, changing main franchise, and the parts are all GM. The cars were basically Vauxhall&rsquo;s &ndash; starting with the Vectra, and ending with the Insignia.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">This obviously had a direct impact on Humberside Motors, but they set out to find a new dealer network to be part of.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">The result saw Grimsby partner up with Renault and its smaller brands (Dacia).</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Hull took a much riskier route, and became the first independent dealer in the country to work with Infiniti. This was September 2012, and Infiniti had exactly ZERO presence in the UK.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Around this time, I was walking around one of the local car shows. Infiniti had come out in force. The one that hooked me into the display, was an M35h. It was apparent that this unheard brand was locked on to Merc, BMW and Audi &ndash; they wanted that market.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">June 2013 &ndash; and the Saab is, sadly, gone. In its place &ndash; an Infiniti EX. A different class of car, but also a considerable ownership experience.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h1 class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">The EX</h1>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Zoom forward to January 2016 &ndash; all is well. The car is great, and the support from Hull is spot on. Hull themselves have won the European Dealer of the Year award.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">In the last 2 years &ndash; I&rsquo;ve driven some VERY nice vehicles.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">September 2014 was fun, starting with the monstrous FX Vettel edition.

My next car is going to be an Infiniti Q50. I&rsquo;m torn between the 2.0t petrol, and the 2.2 CDI.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I&rsquo;m not just basing this choice on the car &ndash; there needs to be support and trust with the local dealer.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">This opinion nearly changed in October 2015, at the Q30 launch.

Paraphrasing:</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&ldquo;Your new nearest Infiniti dealer is Leeds. Your cars servicing has now been fully transferred.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Ok, thanks. Bye.&rdquo;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">What has happened here? Infiniti UK have pulled the plug on one of their most successful dealers.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Customers are now expected to travel from this area, to Leeds. It\\\'s expected that this will just be accepted.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">I go back to a previous statement. \\\"I&rsquo;m not just basing this choice on the car &ndash; there needs to be support and trust with the local dealer.\\\"</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Cars don\\\'t sell themselves. Dealers sell cars. Dealers have a relationship with customers. Customers are the only thing that will ever give Infiniti a start in the UK.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I feel that there\\\'s more to this. When Infiniti first entered the UK, the dealers were all funded by middle-eastern money. Hull was the first independent dealer. In this era, Infiniti saw growth, Hull did well, and the Infiniti UK team seemed to understand how things worked at the forecourt level.</p>\n<p>Going into 2015, Infiniti set up a retail group, to encompass the franchised dealerships. Hull remained independent. During this change in structure - something seems to have been lost. People left at the top level, and the understanding between forecourt and top level has disappeared.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would estimate that Infiniti are selling around 1000 cars per year in the UK. The fact that they are willing to ditch one of their best dealers, and leave the area uncovered is worrying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">Infiniti Hull obviously can&rsquo;t disclose too much &ndash; I respect that. But there needs to be a statement from Infiniti UK on this. They clearly don&rsquo;t understand that the car purchases are based on dealer relationships.</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\">As it stands at the moment (and this is painful) - the Q50 is off my list.</p>',0,1),(15,1453485223,'Windows 10 1511 and beyond with WSUS','<p>Criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2</li>\n<li>WSUS set to download Windows 10 upgrade builds</li>\n<li>WSUS fails to download from the MS servers - event log points to a certificate error.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fix:</p>\n<p><a href=\\\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3095113\\\">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3095113</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This allows WSUS to download and verify the upgrade ESD\\\'s.
